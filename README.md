# WebDev Challenge

Welcome to the JEEC WebDev challenge! In this repository you have all the files you need to complete the challenge.

## Challenge details

You will have to create a Vue3 carousel with four tabs.
Below the carousel, we want you to display the answer to the question and the date that was inserted.

### Tabs in carousel
- Tabs:

  1. In this tab, show a question of your choice.
  2. Next, an input of a date (in any format).
  3. This tab follows the structure of **challenge2.png**, you can add any text, not necessary to be the one in the image. In order to do this, you should use flexbox.
  4. Last, to display an image: **challenge.png**.
