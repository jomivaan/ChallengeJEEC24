# WebDev Challenge

Welcome to the JEEC WebDev challenge! In this folder you have all the files you need to complete the challenge.

## Challenge details

You will have to create a Vue3 carousel with four tabs. Three of the tabs will display a question while the other will be an image.
Below the carousel, we want you to display the answers to the questions.  

### Questions in carousel
Two of the questions can be of your choice while the other must receive as an input a date (in any format).
### Image to display
In this folder you can check the image you should upload to your challenge.
### Useful links and more info

  - [Item 2](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
We do not expect you to do all of this, we want to check how you deal with problems.
If you do a simpler page, it is still good.
